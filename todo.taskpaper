1.0 release:
- Make .ovpn generation work correctly and test it@done
- Implement argparse parents @done
- PEP8 compliance lol ugh @done
- Do I really need a MINIPKI object/class ? @done
- Implement a configuration file @done
- Allow the config.local file to be in the user's homedir or in the cwd or in the scriptdir. @done
- Clean up / organize the command line arguments @done
- In makecnf(), get optional fields like countryName from the config file too @done 
- Clean up comments in makecnf() and make it shorter/more readable @done
- Parameterize remote IP addresses and subnets in ovpn.template@done
- expose build_ca_nsis_installer()@done

- Honestly go thru and make sure there's NOTHING specific to Neuric@done
- integrate newvpnkey.py from work@done
- document what needs to be installed for NSIS to work. LogicLib is 3rd party - anything else?
- clean up subjectAltName section @done
- Temp hack - put a config file param for including a PKI CA in your OVPN config installer@done
- Add a license@done
- Update the README
- Make a Release on Github
- Add generation of self-signed certs @done
- Clean up selfsign function. Some duplicated code in there.
- Add option to generate pfx files for easy importing on Windows machines

Fix the installer (maybe 1.1?):
- NSIS under OS X
- consider replacing NSIS with maybe one of these: http://cyrille.rossant.net/create-a-standalone-windows-installer-for-your-python-application/
- values of output_path and ovpn_nsi_path and probably others that contain spaces will break NSIS. Fix.
- try to guess the location of makensis.exe

More clearly define difference between PKI and VPN roles (maybe 1.2?):
- Have 'minipki vpn' and 'minipki pki' subcommands that have the familiar gen/sign/gensign/etc sub sub commands
- Consider having two sections in the config file too
- Differentiate in docs that PKI = for installation into system CA store and VPN = *just* for ovpn
- Use pki_ca_dir / vpn_ca_dir rather than cwd
- Make sure if there is only pki_ca_dir or vpn_ca_dir specified, the tool behaves sensibly (maybe user has only one of those)
- Perhaps rename project to minica? Or something else. b/c 'minipki pki' looks silly. 

Improve VPN support (maybe 1.3?):
- Generate viscosity configuration as well
- Generate vpn server configuration and setup 

Misc/wishlist (...future):
- Figure out revocation
- makecnf() doesn't match ipv6 addresses
- makecnf() validates IP addresses that are not dotted quads like '4'. This is OK per networking, but I think that OpenSSL won't like this?
- for the --purge argument, only delete files that I created. 
- Consider instructing users to create a separate branch in git for handling their certificate authorities? 
- verify the path of args.also_cacert in argparser so it fails immediately if it's bad
- initca should work on an empty directory only, not on the cwd
- sanity check args.output_path particularly in build_ovpn_nsis_installer()
- add a --installer option for gensign (it already exists for vpngensign)
- clarify the help for the --installer-with-ca option
- having CA_CNF is not consistent; make it consistent in either direction
- move documentation of openssl syntax from comments in initca() into its own document or something
- Is my gut feeling true: that having one CA for both VPN and PKI is a bad idea ?
- Having the catools() function is inelegant and ugly, make this better.
